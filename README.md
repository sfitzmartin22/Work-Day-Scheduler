# Your Project Title
Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project's goal is to create and deploy an application that allows a user to create their work schedule for the day.  This schedule will update the background color of the tasks that are entered based on if the time has passed or not.  I use the local storage to save user submitted information and display it on the webpage after the save button has been hit.  Upon, reloading the page the information will still be there.
